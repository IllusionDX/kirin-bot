# Kirin Bot
A discord bot I made for my server, mainly just for fun.

It's currently very early in development, even though it has existed for 2 years now! I just haven't put the time to improve it.
Anyways I decided to publish it here and make it public, as the license says you can do anything you want with it. 
It's current feature set is very limited, it only has a few commands.

Those include:

- A basic derpibooru search with an embed,
- A 1v1 challenge, a basic game copied from a defunct bot called AnthBot.
- An 8ball command with some unfunny lines.

It's currently available only in Spanish, the code itself is a mess, but I'll work to make to fully in English
and then use an internationalization library to translate it to multiple languages.
Usage
---------------	
You will need the following things to host this bot by yourself:

- At least Python 3.8 and pip to download the requirements
- Set an environment variable called "BOT_TOKEN" and put your bot's token from the developer portal.

Once it gets to the point I consider it presentable enough it will be made fully public and available for everyone, then you would just invite it.
